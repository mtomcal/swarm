I'll start by reading the implementation plan to find an incomplete task to work on.Looking at the implementation plan, I can see that task **7.7 Fix identified memory issues** is the only remaining incomplete task in Phase 7. Let me examine the TEST_AUDIT.md file to understand what memory issues have been identified that need fixing.Now I have a clear picture. Looking at the TEST_AUDIT.md file and the findings from tasks 7.1-7.6, I can see that:

1. **Task 7.1 (Memory profiling)**: Found memory usage is healthy (~45 MB peak), no leaks detected
2. **Task 7.2 (Memory leak patterns)**: No memory leak patterns identified
3. **Task 7.3 (Subprocess management)**: All Popen objects properly managed
4. **Task 7.4 (Tmux cleanup)**: Added robust cleanup utilities
5. **Task 7.5 (String/buffer accumulation)**: No accumulation risks
6. **Task 7.6 (Memory safeguards)**: Created memory monitoring infrastructure

**Task 7.7** states: "Fix identified memory issues - Apply fixes for all identified memory leaks, Add cleanup code where missing, Optimize memory-heavy test patterns, Verify fixes with memory profiling"

However, looking at the audit findings, the analysis consistently shows **no memory leaks were identified**. The summary in TEST_AUDIT.md (Section 20) confirms this - all tasks found the test suite has healthy memory usage.

Looking at the "Summary of Action Items" in TEST_AUDIT.md, I can see what remaining medium/low priority items could be addressed:

**Remaining Medium Priority:**
- Item 4: Replace fixed `time.sleep()` with polling in integration tests
- Item 5: Add test timeout decorators to prevent hanging tests

**Remaining Low Priority:**
- Item 9: Consider reducing mock depth in heavily-mocked tests
- Item 10: Update integration tests to use SWARM_DIR env var for full isolation
- Item 11: Add timeout to subprocess.run in test helper functions

Since the task description says "Fix identified memory issues," and the comprehensive audit found **no memory issues to fix**, the appropriate action is to:

1. Verify the test suite still passes and memory usage is healthy
2. Mark task 7.7 as complete since there are no memory issues to fix
3. Update the implementation plan to reflect that the audit found no fixes needed

Let me verify the test suite runs correctly with the memory safe runner to confirm there are no issues.Good, the memory safe runner is already implemented. Let me run a quick verification with a subset of tests to confirm the memory monitoring is working correctly.The memory monitoring is working correctly. The tests are passing and memory usage is well within limits (~28 MB, far below the 500 MB limit).

Now let me run a broader set of tests to verify everything is working:The tests are running. Let me get the final summary:All 657 tests pass. Now let me update the implementation plan. Looking at the task 7.7, since the comprehensive audit (tasks 7.1-7.6) found **no memory leaks or issues to fix**, the task should be marked as complete with a note that no fixes were required because the analysis found healthy memory usage.Now let me update the TEST_AUDIT.md to add a final conclusion section for task 7.7:Now let me commit the changes:Good. Now let me check recent commits for the commit message style:The files are staged but the commit seems to be waiting. Let me run the commit without background mode:I see there's a pre-commit hook running. Let me wait for it to complete:The commit succeeded. Let me verify:I have completed task 7.7. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Task 7.7: Fix Identified Memory Issues - COMPLETED

**Summary**: The comprehensive memory investigation (tasks 7.1-7.6) concluded that **no memory leaks or issues were found** in the test suite. The test infrastructure already follows best practices:

- Memory usage is healthy (~45 MB peak for full test suite)
- All subprocess/Popen objects are properly terminated
- All file handles use context managers
- Tmux sessions are properly cleaned up
- No large string/buffer accumulation patterns

**Actions taken**:
1. Verified test suite runs correctly with memory monitoring (657 tests passed)
2. Updated IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to mark task 7.7 as complete with findings
3. Added Section 21 to TEST_AUDIT.md documenting the memory investigation conclusion
4. Committed and pushed changes

**Commit**: `135008e audit: complete memory investigation - no fixes needed (task 7.7)`
