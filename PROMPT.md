study specs/README.md
study IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and pick the most important incomplete task - your task is to consolidate ralph under `swarm ralph spawn` and remove the `--ralph` flag from spawn

IMPORTANT:
PICK ONLY ONE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO
update the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md plan when the task is done
you may implement missing functionality if required (but study the specs first before doing so)
if integration/property/unit tests are missing you should add them (but choose which one is most appropriate. follow existing test pattern design)
if tests take too long, remove them or fix them to be shorter. we dont accept long tests and long feedback loop.
update CLAUDE.md with learnings about the project and structure. keep it less than 200 lines and specific to project details and structure
commit and push when you are done
