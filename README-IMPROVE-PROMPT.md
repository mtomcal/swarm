# README Improvement Task

You are iteratively improving the README.md for the Swarm project.

## Instructions

1. **Read the current README.md** to understand its state
2. **Identify ONE specific improvement** from these areas:
   - Clarity and readability
   - Better examples or code snippets
   - Improved organization/structure
   - Missing information that users would need
   - Grammar and style consistency
   - Better visual formatting (tables, headers, etc.)
3. **Make the improvement** - focus on quality over quantity
4. **Commit your change** with a descriptive message like "docs: improve README <what you changed>"
5. **Say "/done"** after committing

## Guidelines

- Make ONE focused improvement per iteration, not multiple changes
- Keep the existing tone and style
- Don't remove valuable content - enhance it
- Ensure all code examples remain accurate
- Test any shell commands you add for correctness

## Progress Tracking

Check the git log to see what improvements have already been made:
```bash
git log --oneline -10
```

If you see 4+ README improvement commits already made, say "/done" - the task is complete.
